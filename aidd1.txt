 Scenario
NextChapter is a startup launching a new platform for book reviews. They want to store structured information about books and reviews.
Book Data
â€¢	bookId
â€¢	title
â€¢	aiMetric (0â€“100, a measure of how well the book is recommended by AI-powered recommendation engines)
â€¢	releaseYear
â€¢	author (single string)
â€¢	genres (list of genres)
â€¢	publisher (embedded: publisherName and location)
â€¢	pages
â€¢	sales (list of yearly sales figures, most recent last)
Review Data
â€¢	reviewId
â€¢	reviewAuthor
â€¢	reviewDate
â€¢	reviewText
â€¢	bookId

Assignment 1
Part 1
Use the sample data at the end of this document to create a list of books and reviews in a text file.
a.	Create a function to load data
b.	Create a function to save the data

Note: The save and load can automatically happen at your choosing of event (i.e. after creating a new book or review) or you can add the ability to a menu system available to the user of your program.

c.	Create a function that prompts a user to create a new
a.	Book
b.	Review
Part 2
Write Python code to create a Menu system for users that includes the ability to â€¦
1.	Load Data
2.	Save Data
3.	Add Book
4.	Add Review
5.	Print the titles of all books released in a user specified year
6.	Print the titles of all books with an AI Metric lower than a user specified value.
7.	Print all books that have at least 1 review (skip books with 0 reviews)

ðŸ¤– AI-Enabled Programming Component
Since this course reflects the AI-first era of software development (2025), you must:
1.	Log your prompts
o	Whenever you use Copilot, ChatGPT, or any AI tool to generate/refactor code, add the prompt (or summary) into a file called .prompt/dev_notes.md.
o	Example:
 	# AI Prompt Log
Prompt: Write Python code to filter books with aiMetric < 50.
AI Suggestion: ...
My Edits: I changed X because Y.
2.	Critique AI Output
o	In comments inside your Python code, explain at least once where AIâ€™s suggestion was helpful and once where it was wrong, incomplete, or needed adjustment.
3.	Demonstrate Understanding
o	Even if AI writes the loop, you must annotate what it does. Your assignment will be graded partly on your explanations and documentation, not only correctness.
